## Vatti Algorithm

There is an excellent book that contains a great description of a Vatti algorithm. For more information
then the information provided here on the Vatti algorithm, please look into this book.

A very simple explanation of the the Vatti algorithm is that it breaking apart rings into [edges](edges.md) - decides what edges should be kept, and then re-assembling the resulting rings.
