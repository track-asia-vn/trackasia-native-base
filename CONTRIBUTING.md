Hi, and thanks in advance for contributing to MapLibre. Here's how we work. Please follow the conventions when submitting an issue or pull request.

## Preparing your Development Environment

change the code and put up a PR draft. The CI/CD takes less than a minute, so it's a reasonable fast way to work on an issue.
