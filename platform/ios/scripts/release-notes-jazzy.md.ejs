# TrackAsia Native for iOS

TrackAsia Native for iOS is an open-source framework for embedding interactive map views with scalable, customizable vector maps into Cocoa Touch applications on iOS 9.0 and above using Objective-C, Swift, or Interface Builder. It takes stylesheets that conform to the [TrackAsia Style Specification](https://track-asia.com/trackasia-style-spec/), applies them to vector tiles that conform to the [Mapbox Vector Tile Specification](https://docs.mapbox.com/data/tilesets/guides/vector-tiles-standards/), and renders them using OpenGL.
