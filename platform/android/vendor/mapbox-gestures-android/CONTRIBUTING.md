# Contributing

We welcome contributions to this gestures repository. If you're interested in helping develop the library, please follow these steps:

- [Open a ticket](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gestures-android/issues/new) to kick off a conversation, feel free to tag the `@mapbox/android` team. It's a good idea to explain your plans before you push any code to make sure no one else is working on something similar and to discuss the best approaches to tackle your particular idea.

- Create a new branch that will contain the code for your additions.

- Pull requests are gladly accepted. If there are any changes that developers should be aware of, please update the [change log](CHANGELOG.md)

- Mapbox uses checkstyle to enforce good Java code standards. Make sure to read the [Mapbox GL Native Wiki entry](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/wiki/Setting-up-Mapbox-checkstyle) and setup. CI will fail if your PR contains any mistakes.
